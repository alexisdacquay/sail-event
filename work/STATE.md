# ProjectOne — work state (resumable)

## Goal
Pick a project for DataTalksClub AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp (ProjectOne = temp name).

## Status
- [x] git init, work file created (2026-10-15)
- [x] fetch project instructions + rubric
- [x] read course modules 01-05
- [x] record understanding (work/UNDERSTANDING.md)
- [x] propose ideas (work/IDEAS.md)
- [ ] user picks idea (OPEN ASK since 2026-10-15)

## Decisions
- 2026-10-15 plugins installed at project scope (user: "yes deploy the 5 skills"):
  feature-dev, frontend-design, pr-review-toolkit, security-guidance, context7.
  -> .claude/settings.json in this folder. global settings unchanged (verified: langfuse only).
  active from the next session start.
- 2026-10-15 skills sonic-hw-recon / datasheet-info-collector: cannot unload mid-session;
  rule: never invoke or infer from them.

## Open asks
- CONFIRM idea K with the user's shape: standard searches + matching criteria + public
  calendar (user proposed 2026-10-15; my assessment in IDEAS.md "K shape v2"). word pending.
- B, C withdrawn. A, E..J remain fallbacks.

## Notes
- datasheet-info-collector is a desktop-app session skill (Application Support/Claude/...),
  not removable from here; user manages it in the app's Skills settings.
- engineering:* skills (architecture, system-design, testing-strategy...) come from a
  desktop-app bundled plugin, global, not project-scoped.
